# MERN PROJECT

Project for **Code Academy Berlin**.

The goal of the project was to create a Social Network App using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) Stack. The Back-End interacts with a React Front-End thought APIs providing the app with key features such as posts, comments, likes and favourites, while ensuring the security of the exchanges using web tokens and access management rules (CRUD).

I chose to simulate a travel agency to be the theme of my API. A visitor can view the expeditions, but cannot interact with the app further. Users who have created an account can favourite an expedition, comment and edit their own account details through the profile page.

Most styled elements are designed with TailwindCSS.
